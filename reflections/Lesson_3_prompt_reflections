Metareflections(How are my reflections different from others'?)
For starters, I am shocked by how many people dont capitalize their Is! I mean, I have bad grammer and all but I usually do okay at the Is. Also, I noticed that most people went with the copy-pasting the questions into the reflections, and I noticed that almost everyone stuck to 1-3 sentence answers for each question. Also, a lot of people used the same filenaming convention as myself. 

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with teams or when working from multiple computers or when working on a project that you want to share with people.
